# Documentation

## `src`
If you navigate to this directory you will find extensive documentation over how *my* code works. If you navigate to this directory you will find the `benternet_server` and `benternet_client` subdirectory. In each of these subdirectories is a `readme.md` file which contains all the more detailed documentation.

If you just simply want to know how to interact with my service than you have come to the right place.

For now you can interact with the service on two ways. There is a chat service and a joke service. But what are these? Look below.

|Service|Description|
|---|---|
|Chat|Allows users to send messages to a topic, which the service fowards to a topic, allowing everyone to see all chats.|
|Joke|Allows users to request a joke.|
