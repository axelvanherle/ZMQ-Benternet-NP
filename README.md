# ZMQ-Benternet-NP

This is a project for Network Programming. The project is about setting up a Deep Net Distributed Computing Cloud called B-Net, providing various services that can be used by individuals and groups, with flexible group sizes and the ability for everyone to participate in this network, where each individual works on their own part or service within the network.

My project has a integrated joke API where users can request jokes. These jokes are sent back to the user that requested it only.

There is also a chat service where users can chat to each other. These messages are forwarded to everyone, so there is a fully functioning chat server. Where everyone can send and receive messages from.

## Documentation
Documentation about the code and how to utilize the service can be found under the `docs` directory.
